%%  Function to monitor serial port for Arduino communication
% When a perturbation is triggered on the treadmill speed values are
% incremented based on the Arduinoâ€™s internal timer.  This program was
% created to verify the exactness of the Arduino's internal timer.
% *******************IMPORTANT*************************
% If the program crashes or errors out, you have to paste clear s; 
% into the command window, otherwise you will be unable to 
% connect to the board again

%% Create Serial Object
s=serialport('COM4',250000,"Timeout",30);
% The first input is the com port the Arduino is plugged into on your computer, this needs
% to match the actual port name.  For a list of the ports currently
% connected use serialportlist in the command window.
 
% The second input is the baud rate.  This needs to match whatever
% is entered into the Arduinos Serial.begin command.  I've found the practical
% maximum is 250000 on my setup.
 
% The third input is miscellaneous modifiers, I set a timeout of 30 seconds
% to close the port if no data is received for 30 seconds.
 
pause(1);   % Wait for 1 second, I found that garbage is transmitted when the port is initially connected

        Tdiff(i) = t-AdruinoTime;   % Calculate the difference between Arduino time and Matlab time, should be similar
